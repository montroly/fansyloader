# fansyloader / fancy loader

Download your content from Onlyfans and Fansly easily and quickly, without reading long installation instructions or making complicated configurations.

## Using

1. Download the [last released version](https://github.com/montroly/fansyloader/releases)
2. Unpack the download
3. Open a bash and navigate to the directory. (For Windows the use of the Powershell is recommended and the script `openshell.bat` is optional included to open the Powershell). 
4. (Optional)

  ```bash
  ./fansyloader setup
  ```

4. Start

  ```bash
  ./fansyloader
  ```

**Credits:** This project would not have been possible without the work of @hippothon, @OFfriend and @DIGITALCRIMINAL (Â±S).
They cleared many barriers during their work on [OnlyFans DataScraper](https://github.com/DIGITALCRIMINALS/OnlyFans).

## Troubleshooting

After the download is started, only the progress bars and no error messages are displayed. 
So if there are problems, you should look into the log file in the `config` directory. 
Alternatively, `show_progress_bar` can be set to `false` in the configuration file.
