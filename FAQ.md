# FAQ

#### Where can I find the source code?

Nowhere. The source code is not public.

#### Are you planning to publish the source code?

No.

#### How do I know I can trust the program?

Not at all, as usual. But you can check it with a virus scanner or online tool. You could monitor the network communication with Wireshark or something else. 

I can tell you that the program does not do anything different from what I have stated here. - It downloads files.
