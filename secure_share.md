## Share data

If you have a problem, it may be necessary to share your log file with me. 
The log file can help me with error analysis, but may contain sensitive information. 
You should therefore never share your log file publicly!

Therefore, if you are willing to share your log file with me, you should encrypt it so that only I and no one else can read it.

### How to encrypt

1. Download the [latest version of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Copy the file into the directory where the `fansyloader` file is located (or deal with how age works)
4. Navigate with a console into the directory
5. Encrypt the log: `age -o log.age -r age14dfxpv8rzxr2mulmdv8zh3lxkj40jpu0n4j6flamdt330q5tefkqzsxdsj config/fansyloader.log`
6. Upload the newly created `log.age` file to your issue

### Public keys

* Age: `age14dfxpv8rzxr2mulmdv8zh3lxkj40jpu0n4j6flamdt330q5tefkqzsxdsj`
